# snarktank

Repository for trading strategy resources and scripts.

## About

This repository collects trading strategy research, Pine scripts, and supporting
tools. It contains the `ai-dev-tasks` utilities and the `ai-dev-tasks-main`
workspace (now vendored into this repo for simplicity).

## Structure

- `ai-dev-tasks/` — helper docs and task lists
- `ai-dev-tasks-main/` — main project files (vendored copy)

## Usage

Clone the repo and (if you previously had submodules) just work with the files:

```
git clone https://github.com/MindOS-Systems/snarktank.git
```
